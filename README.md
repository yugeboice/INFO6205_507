final project 
Topic: SHOPPING CENTER SITE SELECTION

When select a location to construct a Shopping Center, we need  to consider the surroundings buildingâ€™s distance.
When the sum of these buildings to site is less, the possibility we choose it is more.
Besides, the amount of people gathered also matters a lot.

Site selection planning is rationality related to the success or failure of development. Manual location planning is not only inefficient, but also has poor data accuracy.
